Hey, I'm Sky/Wonu (he/they)

Currently, I am taking a break from school but am planning on going for library sciences. I'm also doing art commissions, and video editing.

Feel free to check out what is meant to be my archives, blog, portfolio, and resume on here, although I will probably update semi-consistently.
