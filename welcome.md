# welcome

hey, i'm sky/wonu (he/they)

I'm on a lifelong mission to learn everything I can to improve people's lives, express myself, and better understand how technology transforms humanity.

Currently, I am working at Amazon Web Services as an SDE and in my spare time I am developing a game for Meta Quest.

Feel free to check out my portfolio, resume, and blog on here, although since I'm mostly focused on work I haven't made anything new in a while.
